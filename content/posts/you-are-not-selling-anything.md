> "By selling grain to the people, Joseph eventually collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan, and he put the money in Pharaoh’s treasury." — Genesis 47:14 NLT

If you are broke, chances are you are not selling anything. 

Money comes from people. People buy things. To get money from people is to sell to them. You make or find something you know people will want and sell it to them.

People may sometimes give you money out of benevolence, but the way to continually collect money from people is to sell something they want to buy.

Everyone has something to sell. If you think you have nothing to sell, sell yourself (your talents, skills, time, knowledge, etc.). And frankly speaking, if you're good, people will buy you.

You don't need to produce something before you can sell it. Joseph had no grain of his own, but he sold grain for Pharaoh. So, you can start by selling what other people have to sell. By selling what others produce, you won't have to go through the risk and cost of production.

Selling is simple. It's a numbers game. Just tell people what you're selling and how much they need to pay. Tell as many people as you can, and the rest will take care of itself.

For Joseph, it was grain. For you, it may be something else.
