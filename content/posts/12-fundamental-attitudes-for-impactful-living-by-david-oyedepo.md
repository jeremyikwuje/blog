I recently read the book, _Maximize Destiny_ by David Oyedepo. In the first chapter, he wrote down 12 fundamental attitudes that guarantee impactful living.

According to David Oyedepo, who you are largely determines what you become. It is your attitude that defines your altitude. The strength of your character determines the greatness of your destiny, and your way of life right now is vital in determining your future.

As you read these 12 fundamental attitudes and implement them into your life, I believe it will make your life impactful.

> "_**In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:**_

> _**Who, being in very nature of God, did not consider  
> equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross!  
> Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,**" - Phil 2:5-9_

  

## 1. Be Decisive

One key reason people remain where they are is because they are indecisive. Indecision is the biggest cause of stagnation, frustration, and devastation. People who are always thinking whether "to go, or not to go" usually get nowhere. To get somewhere, you have to make a decision to go there.

To be great is to be decisive. If you don't decide to be great, you can't be great. It is your choices that define your lot in life.

Decisiveness is not something you are born with, you have to cultivate it. It is not a gift or an endowment (Gen 49: 1-3; James 1:6; Jude 5:16-17).

When David Oyedepo was to begin his ministry in 1982, there was stiff opposition to going full-time, but he told himself “Lord, should I pretend not to have heard you, see to it that I do not succeed in anything else that I do”

Paul is speaking in 1 Corinthians 9:16:

> **Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.**

And Philippians 1:21 he said:

> **For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.**

## 2. Be Strong

To be strong, is to be brave and courageous (Jos 1:4-6). It is only the brave that dares, and only the daring accomplishes new marks. It takes courage to conquer. It is courage that breeds conquest.

Until you are stretched, the star in you can not manifest, and it requires strength to do exploits. Men and women of exploits are usually known to be dogged and enduring.

It takes multidimensional strength to maximize destiny: spiritual strength (Eph 3:16), mental strength (Prov 24:3-5), emotional strength (Jn 2:17, Ps 69:6) and physical strength (Heb 10:3-5, Lk 12:49-50).

## 3. Be Disciplined

It was George Washington that said: “Discipline is the soul of an army; it makes small numbers formidable, it procures strength to the weak and esteem to all.”

Only highly disciplined people become truly distinguished. The future of any man remains bleak without the virtue of disciplined. To be disciplined here implies to be purpose-driven, that is, operating as demanded, not as convenient.

Disciplined also means to be orderly and cultured. That is a lifestyle of mature behaviour. Nobody is born or endowered with discipline, it is a habit we build.

## 4. Be Determined

To be determined is to be committed to a goal with all your heart. And you see this attribute with men and women of exploits. We are told in the scriptures that _Solomon determined in his heart to build a house for the name of the Lord, and a house for his Kingdom._

Determination is an emotional force that secures our distinction in the race of life. People with the “If I perish and I perish” mentality, have a catalyst of destiny.

Determination is the driving force in the race of destiny.

## 5. Be focused

King Solomon tried to paint a picture of the value of Focus:

> _**Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother’s sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I had to neglect. - SOS 1:6**_

Without focus, people have no value. Without focus destiny is stranded, The more focused one is, the faster he becomes in the race of destiny. To be running “here and there” is to lose one place in destiny. Jack of all trades, they say, master of none.

The parable shared by one of the prophets in the Book of Kings further exposes the danger of a lack of focus:

> _**“As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, “Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, ‘Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent of silver.’ While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.” - 1 Kings 20:39-40 (NIV)**_

Destiny is lost to a lack of focus. That is why Paul the great Apostle said, _“For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.”_ (Phil 1:21). He further said, _“But this one thing I do, I press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”_ (Phil 3:13-14).

More often than not, only those who live for one thing become outstanding. Jesus Christ Himself said, _“To this end was I born, and for this course came I to the world, to bear witness unto the truth”_ (Jn 18:37) also, it was recorded that Jesus set his face upon Jerusalem like a Flint.

Focused men are potential first-class citizens of the earth.

### 6. Be Upright

Nothing perverse destiny like integrity. The Bible says, “The integrity of the upright shall guide him” (Prov 11:3). So, let your yes be yes, and your no, no (James 5:12). Those who succeed by tricks usually get trapped. But those who succeed by truth are certain to triumph always and in every place (2 Cor 2:14).

It is only the path of the just that is as the shining light, that will continue to shine more and more unto the perfect day. (Prov 4:18).

The uprightness of Joseph was responsible for his greatness as a slave (Gen 39:1-9). No wonder it is written.

> _**“Unto the upright, there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous.“ (Psalm 112:4)**_

It is required of stewards that a man be found faithful. (1 Cor 4:2).

To be faithful is to be fruitful! The Bible says, _“A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent”_ (Prov 28:20).

Faithfulness is the guarantee for promotion (Mat 25:21). Lack of faithfulness can terminate anyone’s stewardship! Be upright! It is a commandment.

## 7. Be Merciful

Blessed are the merciful: for they shall have mercy.

Compassion is an asset in the journey of life. The help you render determines the kind of help you receive.

I remember vividly an experience I had during my growing-up days. My mother had a very “disturbing” habit of serving food to all our tenants’ children. More disturbing was the fact that we (her children) were the ones to wash up the dishes. On one vacation, I asked her, “Why must you serve these children? Did their parents complain to you about lack of food?” She said, “No?” “But why?” I asked her, and she answered, “Your children will be somewhere tomorrow and someone else would have to serve them.”

It is happening today, to the glory of God.

## 8. Be Selective

The company you keep either makes or breaks you. It is, therefore, important to be selective in the friendship you keep. For _“He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed”_ (Prov 13:20).

I believe that friendship should not be by force, but by choice. The says two cannot walk together unless they are agreed (Amos 3:3). Walking with just anyone is no proof of love. In fact, it is the very definition of foolishness. Paul the Apostle said:

> **“Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.”** - 1 Corinthians 15:33

## 9. Be Sensitive

The Bible exclaims:

“**_Hear, you deaf;_****_  
look, you blind, and see!  
Who is blind but my servant,  
and deaf like the messenger I send?  
Who is blind like the one in covenant with me,  
blind like the servant of the Lord?  
You have seen many things, but you pay no attention;  
your ears are open, but you do not listen._”** - Ish 42: 18-20

We must be all ears and all eyes to make the most of the race of destiny. We must be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit because when God leads, the going goes great. The more sensitive you are to the Holy Spirit, the more understanding the adventure of life becomes. Most of the turning points in my life came through spiritual sensitivity to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.

The vision that birthed the liberation mandate was conveyed through the aid of spiritual sensitivity. On that great day, May 1 1981, the Lord said to me, “Seek a quiet place, I want to talk to you” Again, Canaan Land, our ministry’s world headquarters, which used to be a forest and in the midst of nowhere, has become a city to the glory of God. However, I remember that the first day I was brought to see the land, I remarked sharply, “This could not be a place for the church.” But, as the few of us on the entourage joined our hands to pray, the Spirit of God said to me, “This is the place.”

It is important to remain spiritually sensitive.

## 10. Be Joyful

I have always maintained that the happier you are, the higher you will fly. Paul the Apostle, one of the most outstanding “Apostlictic Eagles” in history unfolded one of the secrets of his life when he said:

> **_Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. - Philippians 4:4_**

Again he said:

> _**Rejoice evermore. - 1 Thessalonians 5:16**_

Why? it is because the more joyful you are, the healthier you will become, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually, because, “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones” (Prov 17:22). The Bible said that “the joy of the LORD is (the source of) your strength” (Neh 8:10).

The Lord Jesus Christ was said to be anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows (Ps 45:6-8). The Bible further records that, “in the hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit” (Lk 10:21).

Be Joyful so you can remain fruitful and impactful (Joel 1: 11-12).

## 11. Be Meek

Meekness is one of your greatest virtues in life. One of the greatest mortals that ever walked the planet Earth, the man Moses, was said to be the meekest of all men on the face of the Earth:

> _**“Now the man Moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.”**_ - Numbers 12:3

Therefore, I believe that is true meekness that defines actual greatness. Remember Jesus also said, “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth” (Matt 5:5).

Our enlargement here on earth is, therefore, a function of our meekness. The meeker we are, the higher we will fly.

Hear this: “God has no problem working if there is no one stealing His glory.” One of my most revered mentors operates a pace-setting ministry with an unprecedented inflow of men into his meetings in hundreds of thousands. One day, I asked the Lord, “What is the secret behind this man’s exploits?” The Lord said to me, “It is not his prayers, neither is it his fasting, that has made him, but his meekness.

Oh! What a virtue to cultivate and uphold!

## 12. Be Grateful

This is acknowledging the grace of God as you move towards the fulfilment of your vision. Never take God for granted. When you despise the days of small things, you miss the greatness that lies ahead. Every great result is rooted in God.

Look at where you are now and convince yourself of God’s backing in getting there. Ingratitude shuts you off from God’s blessings. Be grateful for every stage you get to in life. Gratitude is what brought Solomon to his place of eternal encounter. Grateful people do not miss greatness.

Those who truly celebrate their God in the kingdom become celebrities.

> _**“Bless the  Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;” - Psalm 103: 1-3**_

When you sit down to constantly locate issues of thanksgiving in your life, you will never be stranded in the pursuit of your vision. Gratitude grants you access to the abiding presence of God, which makes a difference anywhere.

It is His grace that defines your limits. Therefore, if we are anything at all, we are what we are by the grace of God.

It is ingratitude that turns grace into disgrace, glory and success into shame. The Word says:

> “**_If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the_ _Lord_ _of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart._” -** Mal 2:1-2

We must, therefore lay it to heart to always give God all the glory for His wondrous works in our lives.
