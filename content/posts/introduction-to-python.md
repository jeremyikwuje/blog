Have you ever thought of becoming a data specialist like a data engineer, data scientist, or even a data analyst?

Well, one of the tools you will be using a lot when working with data is Python.

## What is Python?

Frankly, I think Python no longer need any introduction. But just in case you don't know what it is, let me explain.

Python is a computer programming language. Programming languages are majorly used for writing computer software or executing tasks. Software like Microsoft Word, Excel, and Photoshop were developed using programming languages. Even mobile applications like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Gmail were created with a programming language.

Since Python is a programming language, it can be used to develop different varieties of software like web scrapers, photo editing tools, chatbots, games, shell scripts, automation and several more.

Big tech companies like Google, Uber, Spotify, and Meta use Python in developing their software.

However, Python is not limited to creating software, Python is the language of choice for data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts.

  

## Why Python

Data specialists find it easier to work with Python because the language is simple, expressive and consistent. There are thousands of matured libraries for nearly anything you want to do with data.

For example, as a data specialist in a school, you are given a list of scores about 100 of them.

```python

scores = [ 8, 7, 3, 8, 2, 5, 10, ... ]

```

Assuming you want to add 5 to each of these scores. One way you can do this with Python is by using List Comprehension:

```python

added_scores = [ score + 5 for score in scores]

```

Just a single line of code.

Complex data getting and manipulation can be easily done with Python using libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Numpy, and even SciktLearn for machine learning.

## Is learning Python worth it?

Python was created by a guy named Guido van Rossum. It was first released on Feb 20, 1991, over 30 years ago. It is a mature and consistent language. It's growing in popularity every day as you can see below.



  

> According to Tiobe Index 2023 June report, Python is the #1 programming language in the world.

  

Python will continue to grow in demand and maintain its top position considering the rise of AI innovations like ChatGPT. Learning Python is one of the best investments you can make in yourself in a world where Data and AI are taking over.

Learning Python is easier and more versatile compared to other data-related languages like R, Scala, or Javascript. To start using Python all you need is to install the official Python package from [www.python.org](http://www.python.org/) for macOS, Windows, or Linux and you are good to go.

If you don't want to bother about installation or you use an OS like ChromeOS, you can start coding Python on Replit.

## I'll teach you Python.

Starting with these posts, I want to release a new series dedicated to Python programming language for data specialists. It will contain the topics you need to know to become a data engineer or related roles.

Stay tuned.
