After I graduated from the university, one of my interests was to become a money manager. Over the years, I have jotted down some financial advice from notable experts in my notes. One of these experts is Dave Ramsey.

Dave Ramsey is an American radio personality, personal finance expert, and author. He is the founder and CEO of Ramsey Solutions, a company that offers financial education and products. Ramsey is best known for his nationally syndicated radio show, The Dave Ramsey Show, which is heard by over 13 million listeners each week. He has also written several books on personal finance, including the New York Times bestseller [The Total Money Makeover](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277).

Here are 5 things to wealth by Dave Ramsey taken from my notes:

### 1. Have a budget
You must have a budget before the months begins. 

And you must write it down, not on your phone or head but write it down on paper. This is a serious problem with people who are broke. Either they don't have a budget or they do, but it is written in their head or phone.

So, very important, have a budget.

### 2. Get out of debt

Fast!

A borrower is a slave to a lender - **Proverbs 22:7-9**.

God does not use debt to blesses people.  Biblically speaking, debt is just stupid.

### 3. Have quality relationship

Dsyfunction cost you money. Avoid working on dsyfunctional relationships.

Play well with others. Have integrity. Have character.

Hang out with the right people. Quality relationships changes everything. You are who you hang around with.

### 4. Save & Invest money

If you spend everything you make you are a fool.

There is a chance something bad is going to happen in life. 

So don't spend all you have, save first, then invest at the right time.

### 5. Learn to give

People who have money going for them give. They give their money, their time, and they help others.

Ramsey's advice has helped millions of people improve their financial situation. And I believe if you follow his advice above and in patience, you will go from being broke to having enough money to give and invest in others.
