No one has infinite money. Everyone has a limit on everything. The thing you spend on, you have given yourself the permission to do so.

To set a budget, 

1. List how much money is coming to you monthly after taxes and others. 
2. List your monthly expenses. Start with fixed and most important expenses before listing others such as giving.
3. Total your expenses and substact from your money coming in.

If you have little money to cover up most of your expenses monthly, remember to list and budget only on expenses you must make for that month. If it still can't cover up your most important expenses, then it a sign you should try adding new source of income.

The process of setting a great budget is to give every single dollar a goal and a budget. It should be a zero budget. Everything budgeted.
