If you are interested in starting a career in data science or data engineering, one of the tools you will need to be familiar with is Python. Python is one of the most popular computer programming languages chiefly used among data specialists. Outside data, it is popularly used by software developers for building several kinds of applications like websites, mobile app backends, chatbots, automation, and more. Big companies like Google, Instagram, Spotify, and Uber hire professionals that are proficient in Python.

In this tutorial, I will walk you through how to install Python on your computer and write your first program.

## Prerequisite

Some modern computers already have Python installed. So before you follow the steps in this tutorial, first verify if you have Python installed on your computer.

**To check if Python has already been installed on your machine, follow [Step 3](#step-3) of this tutorial and follow the instructions.**

If Python is installed, continue with Step 4, no need to start from Step 1.

## Step 1: Download Python

Open a new browser tab on your computer and navigate to www.python.org.

On the Python website click on [Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\*\*.

By default, you will see a download button to download Python for your operating system. For instance, if you are on Windows you will see "Download Python for Windows". Follow the instructions on the page and download the latest Python (Python 3) for your operating system.

> There is Python for Windows, Linux, and macros. At the time of this writing, the latest version is **Python 3.11.4**. If you are using a Windows 7 laptop, you can only use **Python 3.9** and below.

## Step 2: Install Python

Once you successfully download the right Python package for your computer operating system, the next thing is to install it. Go to your Downloads or anywhere you store your internet downloads and double-click on the Python installation package.

This will display an installation screen.

**Select the option *"Add Python.exe to Path"* and *"Use Admin privileges"* if displayed on the installation screen.** **Then Click on Install Now to proceed with the installation.**

## Step 3: Verify your Python installation

Open Terminal on your macOS. On Windows it's Command Prompt or Powershell.

**Type in the following command:**

```
python -v
```

What's the response?

```
Python 3.10.5
```

If you get a response similar to the above, then you have successfully installed Python your machine.

If otherwise, maybe you got an error, then something went wrong with your installation. Make sure you follow the steps above correctly.

## Step: 4: Write your first program

In the Terminal, **enter the following command:**

```
python 
```

This will output the Python console.

```
Python 3.10.5 (tags/v3.10.5:f377153, Jun  6 2022, 16:14:13
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

In the Python console, **type in the following Python code**.

```
print ("Hello, World!")
```

**Hit *Enter***.

What's the response?

```
Hello, World!
```

You should get the above response "Hello, World!" on the console:

Congratulations you have successfully installed Python on your machine and written a simple Python program to output "Hello, World!".
