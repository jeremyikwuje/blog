Greetings from the BitPension team! I'm excited to share the news about our initiative to integrate Bitcoin into the workplace, empowering employees in the process.

At BitPension, our goal is Better Asset, and we've chosen Bitcoin as our means to achieve this. Bitcoin, with its decentralized, global, and public digital infrastructure, serves as an ideal platform for wealth accumulation. While our services are open to everyone, we recognize the importance of concentrating our efforts in the private sector to fulfill our mission for Africans.

Since our participation in the African Bitcoin Hackathon, our primary focus has been disrupting the pension industry and facilitating Bitcoin adoption in the private sector. The pension industry in Africa, being one of the oldest yet lacking innovation, manages trillions of dollars using outdated methods such as papers, pens, and spreadsheets. Our vision is to create a financial future that is more equitable and liberating for employees.

Today, we are pleased to announce the following developments:

1. **We have initiated visits to companies in Nigeria, enabling their employees to invest in Bitcoin for retirement, potential layoffs, and career changes. So far, we have engaged with 81 companies, with 27 of them pre-signing up over 200 employees on our [commitment waitlist](https://tally.so/r/mY4MR5).**

2. In addition to long-term investment opportunities, employees will have the option to secure a loan using their Bitcoin assets as collateral. This provides them with the flexibility to access liquidity during emergencies or when embarking on their own business.

3. **Discussions are underway for a partnership with Stitch Money, allowing individuals in South Africa to link their bank accounts and invest recurring amounts in Bitcoin monthly, even if they are not on a company payroll.**

4. We've reached out to prominent entities such as Unchained, Kingdom Trust, and others in our quest for a globally recognized custodian asset manager offering multiple key wallet solutions.

5. **In our commitment to being the premier Bitcoin investment account for employees, we plan to add support for a synthetic dollar like USDT. Approximately 60% of employees on our commitment list have shown interest in allocating a portion of their investment to synthetic yield-generating dollar assets rather than having their entire portfolio in Bitcoin.**

6. As part of our service offering, we are providing Fedimint federation setups for companies, groups, and unions seeking to self-manage and custody their Bitcoin within a community context.

We're enthusiastic about the positive changes BitPension will bring to the financial landscape, fostering a fairer and more accessible future for all.
