Yo! from the BitPension team. I'm thrilled to announce how we are bringing Bitcoin to the workplace and empowering employees.

At BitPension, our product mission is Better Asset. To achieve better asset for all, we use Bitcoin: decentralized, global, and public digital infrastructure for wealth accumulation. While Bitcoin and BitPension are open to everyone, to better serve our product mission to Africans, we know that we need to focus our service in the private sector, making Bitcoin and BitPension enabled for employees in private companies.

Since BitPension joined the African Bitcoin Hackathon, a key priority of the product focus has been to disrupt the pension industry and enable Bitcoin in the private sector. We know that the pension industry is the oldest industry in Africa lacking any form of innovation. Trillions of dollars are still managed in debased currencies using papers, pens, and spreadsheets. We have envisioned a financial future thatâ€™s fairer and freer for employees.

Today, we are announcing:

- We have begun visiting companies in Nigeria to enable their employees to invest in Bitcoin for retirements, potential layoffs, and career change. We have been able to communicate with 81 companies and got 27 companies to pre-signup their 200+ employees on our commitment [waitlist](https://tally.so/r/mY4MR5).

- We are currently having a partnership talk with Stitch Money! Individuals in South Africa (including those who may not be on a company payroll) will be able to connect their bank accounts and invest recurring amounts in Bitcoin monthly.

-  Employees will have the option to secure a loan using their Bitcoin assets as collateral. This provides them with the flexibility to access liquidity during emergencies or when embarking on their own business.

- We have reached out to companies like Unchained, Kingdom Trust, and a handful of others as we seek to have a globally recognized custodian asset manager that offers multiple key wallet solutions.

- We want BitPension to be the best Bitcoin investment account for the future. We will add support for a synthetic dollar like USDT. About 60% of the employees in our commitment list clicked on the option to keep a portion of their investment in synthetic yield-generating dollar assets rather than their entire portfolio in Bitcoin.

- As part of our service, we are offering Fedimint federation setups for companies, groups, and unions looking to self-manage and custody of their Bitcoin in a community context.

We're enthusiastic about our progress so far, and we can't wait to see the impact of BitPension in African.
