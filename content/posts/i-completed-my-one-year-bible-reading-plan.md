Today, September 14, 2023, I completed my one-year Bible reading plan. I started in August 2022 with a goal of reading five chapters aloud every day for 20 minutes. This goal was inspired by Rabbi Daniel Lapin, encouraged by Myles Munroe and Paul Eneche.

The goal was simple, but not easy. There were many mornings when I skipped, days when I missed, and times when I felt bored. But as I kept going, I began to enjoy it. There were even days when I read ten chapters or for nearly an hour.

I started with the King James Version, then the New Living Translation, and finally the Good News Translation. I found that the King James Version is best for in-depth Bible study, but not for daily reading because the words and sentence structures are difficult and outdated.

I felt that it would be too daunting to read through the entire Bible in one year, so I decided to start with the New Testament. I finished it in three months, which encouraged me to start the Old Testament.

I enjoyed reading Genesis and Exodus, but I found Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers to be boring. However, I was very interested in Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and the prophets. I read these chapters slowly and sometimes multiple times. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Jonah, and Malachi were particularly powerful, as they exposed me to new truths that I had never heard from a preacher.

I plan to make reading the Bible a lifelong habit. As I have read more, I have gained a deeper understanding of God and His word. I have also experienced more peace of mind, confidence, and calmness in my life. Additionally, my speech has improved drastically.

I encourage everyone to read the Bible. There is no perfect time to start, so don't wait. Just begin, and make it a habit, not a competition.

I read the Bible aloud for two reasons. First, I believe that it is more beneficial to read it aloud than silently. When you read aloud, you engage your mind, mouth, and ears in the process of learning about God. Second, I find it to be a more personal experience.

Here are some tips for reading the Bible:

-   Read from Genesis to Revelation.
-   Read aloud if you can.
-   Set a daily goal.
-   Be consistent, even if you miss a day.
-   Don't worry about understanding everything.
-   Ask God to help you understand His word.

I wish you a successful life ahead in Jesus' name.
